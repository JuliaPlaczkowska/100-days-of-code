### R1D1 
**Today's Progress:** Learning about Design Patterns from [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-basic-design-patterns-all-developers-need-to-know/).

**Notes:**
There are 3 types of design patterns:

#### 1.	Creational
 - *Creational pattern* refers to class-creation or object-creation.
- *The Singleton Design Pattern* is the basic example of creational type. It's objective is to create only one instance of a class and provide only one global access point to that object. There can be many different implementations of singleton design, such as *Eager Instantion*, *Lazy Instantion*, *Thread-safe Instantion*.

#### 2. Structural
- *Structural pattern* increases the functionality of the classes without disturbing its composition.
- *The Decorator Design Pattern* allows adding new functionality to an exsiting object without altering its structure by creating a *decorator class* which wraps the original class and adds new functionalities.


#### 3. Behavioral
- *Behavioral pattern* focuses on how classes and objects communicate with each other.
- *The Command Design Pattern* encapsulates in an object all the data required for performing a given action.
